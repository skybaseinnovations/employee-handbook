# Daily Work Updates

All work updates are managed through **Karyabase** (our project management tool). However, daily summaries must also be posted on **Discord**.

## Channels
-   **Employees:** `#updates`
-   **Interns:** `#intern-updates` (Contact admin if you don't have access).

## Format
Please use the following format for your daily updates:

```text
**Update [Date]**
*[Project Name]*
 - [list of tasks completed/worked on]
```

**Example:**

**Update 11 Feb**

*b2bsolution*
 - updated dashboard, order, comment, product page

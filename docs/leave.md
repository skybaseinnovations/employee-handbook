Our working hours in a day will be 8 hours, including an hour break for lunch and other personal work. We are flexible in our working hours in case of an emergency. Depending on the circumstances, you may need to work overtime. We will give you as much advance notice as possible when you need to work overtime. Overtime work should only be done after being explicitly instructed and approved by the Operations Manager.

## Time Schedule
Our time schedule is normally 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM

## Holidays
The office remains closed on Saturdays. We are not a school, so we don’t have a lot of holidays, but we have some for the days we think you should be staying home. Our holidays mostly align with the government holidays for festivals, so everyone can celebrate their auspicious occasions. We do not discriminate against anyone based on their origin, gender, ethnicity, and religion but we want everyone to have a holiday on the day they need the most. For example, a resident of the Terai region gets a day off on the day after Fagu Purnima.

## Absence and Delay
You need to report to work when scheduled. You should apply for a leave on our [Skybase Karya](https://www.karya.skybase.com.np) advance to your immediate supervisor or the designated manager if you are going to be absent. We expect you to be at your workstation at the beginning of each working day. In case of delay, you must call your immediate supervisor to state the reason for the delay. In case your immediate supervisor is unavailable, you must reach out to your manager personally, or through a coworker. Only some absences fall under the compensation criteria of the company’s leave and benefits policies.

## Notice of Absence
You must give notice at least 24 hours ago if you intend to take leave for the next day. That means, if you are planning to take a leave tomorrow, you should inform us today; you should notify us before or as soon as you arrive. In case of unforeseen events, you must personally notify the Operations Manager as soon as you are aware that you will be late or unable to report to work.

Leaving a voicemail or message with another staff member does not qualify as a notice.

## Medical Emergency
When an absence is due to illness, or medical emergency the company reserves the right to require appropriate medical documentation. Such documentation need only include the contractor’s name, the date and time a medical officer saw the contractor, and if applicable, a specific instruction regarding the contractor’s incapacity to perform his or her job. Excessive absenteeism or tardiness can result in discipline, up to and including discharge.
